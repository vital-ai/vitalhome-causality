domain-json-data
================

directory for file containing json data of individuals defined in OWL ontologies

this may be temporary if such data gets included in the json schema files directly

each domain where it has data will have a corresponding file here

these files may be copied into an application similar to schema files

a javascript file may be generated to allow including them easily in a browser side app
